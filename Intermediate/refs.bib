	abstract = {The use of context-free grammars to define the syntax of programming languages is complicated by the phenomenon of ambiguity. Ambiguity can be resolved by the specification of a unique canonical parse. A set of rules is given which defines a canonical bottom-up parse, and these rules are implemented in a left-to-right bottom-up parsing algorithm. A second set of rules is given which defines a canonical top-down parse, and these rules are similarly implemented in a left-to-right top-down parsing algorithm.},

	abstract = {Ambiguous Context Free Grammars (CFGs) are problematic for programming languages, as they allow inputs to be parsed in more than one way. In this paper, we introduce a simple non-deterministic search-based approach to ambiguity detection which non-exhaustively explores a grammar in breadth for ambiguity. We also introduce two new techniques for generating random grammars --Boltzmann sampling and grammar mutation --allowing us to test ambiguity detection tools on much larger corpuses than previously possible. Our experiments show that our breadth-based approach to ambiguity detection performs as well as, and generally better, than extant tools.},
